# Event helper

![events view](/fl-darkbot/index_assets/events_table.png)

This feature was implemented on request from Event manager Barrier, for the purpose of easily tracking
that all players participating in event, arrived to the scene.

- `. player event add PlayerPreffixOrSuffix` - add player for tracking for event
- `. player event add Any Partial Name` - add player for tracking for event

- `. player event remove Any Partial Name` - remove specific one from tracking

- `. player event list` -  check tracked players
- `. player event clear` - clear all tracked players

P.S. ensure you used `. connect` first one some channel to turn one bot on.
Beware. bot automatically erases msgs for the channel for comfort of its usage.
Use bot on dedicated channel.
